# IPTOOLS
HTML PHP tools that should just work.  Basic santization input is provided.  Feel free to use or reach out if updates are needed.  These are loosely based on older scripts of the same type that have become depreciated over the years.
These are completely written from scratch to be functional with modern PHP.

# REQUIREMENTS
WHOIS requires the WHOIS binary to be installed on the server and accessable from the web user.
